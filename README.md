This app was developed in the DataButton IDE online and so cannot be run locally on a machine. To run the code, you would have to add it to a new project on the IDE, upload the image icon files for the UI to the project storage, add on OpenAI API key as a secret to the project (for confidentiality) and configure the project to use the following packages: 

streamlit_chat_media
openai
transformers
torch
tensorflow
accelerate

The image files are included in the project folder and the app code can be found in the bot.py file.
I have included a like to the deployed version og my web app here: https://databutton.com/v/n5jrbj6j
